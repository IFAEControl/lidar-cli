\section{Running licli}
\subsection{First steps}
To be able to run licli the first step is to specify the IP address of the server. This is done by defining LIDAR\_ADDR environment variable. For example if the server is running in the local host we can \emph{export LIDAR\_ADDR="127.0.0.1"}\\
\linebreak
If it's the first time we run licli it would ask us to introduce a password. This password is defined in the configuration file of the lidar server software. 
In case that it's not the first time and jwt secret has changed we can have some errors like \textbf{"The Token's Signature resulted invalid when verified using the Algorithm"}. If it's the case remove \textit{\~{}/.cache/lidar/token} and try again.\\

\subsection{Examples}

Open doors: \textbf{./licli motors doors \texttt{-{}-}open}\\
Get converted sensors values: \textbf{./licli llc sensors}\\
Make 4 shots with disc level 2: \textbf{./licli operation acq \texttt{-{}-}shots=4 \texttt{-{}-}disc=2}. Output data will be in \textit{\~{}/.local/share/lidar-cli}.

\subsection{Start up}
To start up the system in the standard way execute the "startup" command of \ref{operationcmds}.\\

If for some reason this fails we can do it manually with the next commands:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{./licli motors doors \texttt{-{}-}open}
	\item \textbf{./licli operation ll  \texttt{-{}-}micro-init}
	\item \textbf{./licli motors telescope \texttt{-{}-}sz=600}
	\item \textbf{./licli motors petals \texttt{-{}-}open}
	\item \textbf{./licli llc laser \texttt{-{}-}init}
	\item  \textbf{./licli llc laser \texttt{-{}-}power=5}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Data acquisition}
When an acquisition is made the server stores the data in the licel format and returns an ID, this file can be afterwards downloaded using that identifier. For example to make an acquisition with discriminator at 4 and 100 shots:\\
\textbf{./licli operation acq \texttt{-{}-}shots=100 \texttt{-{}-}disc=4}  (this will return the file ID, 1234 for example)
\textbf{./licli operation acq \texttt{-{}-}download=1234 \texttt{-{}-}disc=4}
\subsection{Shutdown}
To shutdown the system in the standard way execute the "shutdown" command (section \ref{operationcmds} briefly describes what it does). \\

\subsection{Warm up}
The command for the warm up is described in section \ref{operationcmds}.

\subsection{Connect to internal network}
There are two switches. One of them is used for all the devices that are accessible from outside the container, the other contains all devices connected to the internal network. To access this network connect a laptop with an ethernet cable to this internal switch with 255.255.255.0 as the mask and an IP equal or below 192.168.127.230. Inside this local network the server is at 192.168.127.253.

\section{Commands reference}
\textbf{Note: }Commands marked as \textbf{debug} are commands used for debugging purposes.\\
\linebreak
Unless other commands, operation commands (\ref{operationcmds}) are complex commands. Those complex commands can be macros (ie: a couple of commands executed sequentially) or control functions which makes use of the other functions.

\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Acquisition}
The acquired data is first stored in the server in licel file format. The server will return a file ID so we can download that file at anytime. Files are also downloaded automatically so we don't need to download it manually.
\begin{itemize}
	\item[-{}-] \textbf{disc}: Discriminator level. Always required.
	\item[-{}-] \textbf{download}: Download licel file. Argument is the ID (unsigned integer) of the licel file we want to download.

\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Telescope}

	\item[-{}-] \textbf{ramp-single}: Modify voltage of a single DAC. Argument must follow the format idx:voltage.
	\item[-{}-] \textbf{ramp-up}: Ramp up all DACs
\end{itemize}

\section{Configuration}
Configuration files can be found on \textit{\~{}/.config/lidar/client/}. Currently there is only one file, micro\_init\_sequence.properties which can be used to defines arm alignment position, pmt voltages.

\section{Troubleshooting}
In case of unknown problems, increase verbosity level to gather more information. To do this define \emph{LIDAR\_VERBOSITY} with an integer in the range of [1, 4].
\subsection{The Token's Signature resulted invalid...}
This happens when the cached token is not correct. To fix it simply remove \textit{\~{}/.cache/lidar/token} and try again. This way a new token will be generated.\\
\subsection{This method is not safe/read-only}
This means that the keylock is on which means that only those commands that don't produce side effects are allowed (ie: read-only commands) for example to read the status, etc. To fix it someone have to go physically and switch off the keylock.\\
Note that enabling the keylock doesn't kill current running commands
\subsection{Where is X,Y,Z file/directory}
This program follow the XDG Base Directory specification. The full specification may be found on \url{https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html}\\
\linebreak
In short: config files are in \textit{ \~{}/.config/lidar}. Data is in \textit{\~{}/.local/share/lidar}. Cache content is in \textit{\~{}/.cache/lidar}.
